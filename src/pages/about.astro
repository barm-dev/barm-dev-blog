	<p>👋 Hi, I’m Benoit — a data architect who has been passionate about data warehouses and business intelligence since 2010. Over the years, I’ve had the chance to work with a wide range of tools, from Qlikview, Tableau and PowerBI to Snowflake and Microsoft SQL Server, but also some older or more specialized solutions such as Crystal Reports, Talend, Essbase (that's a dinosaur!) ....</p>

	<p>From the very beginning, my approach has always been the same: focus on the business needs and deliver concrete, effective solutions for end users. More than once, I’ve had to challenge flashy dashboards that looked impressive but failed to provide real value. As an architect, I also design data warehouses, where I often push back against common misconceptions — too much history, too much data, or too little focus on data quality — as well as the ever-changing “trends” in architectures and tools. And while I value best practices, I believe delivering a working project always comes first, even if it means compromising on perfection. To me, an imperfect solution that helps users today is better than a perfect one that never gets delivered.</p>
	<p>This blog is my way of sharing that experience. It’s both a space for reflection and a practical support tool to frame projects and create solutions that truly transform data into value.</p>
	<p>Outside of work, I’m a father, which doesn’t always leave much free time. I enjoy taking care of my home, improving the garden, or transforming existing spaces.</p>
	<p>And when I do get a quiet moment, you’ll probably find me enjoying a good glass of wine or a beer — ideally in the garden after finishing a DIY project, even if it didn’t quite go as planned.</p>
