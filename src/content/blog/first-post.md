ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Benoit.

For years, Iâ€™ve carried around a notebook full of ideas â€” some big, some small, all waiting for the right moment to take shape.

Now, with the rise of generative AI, Iâ€™ve found the perfect partner to help turn those ideas into reality.

This blog is my open workshop: a place where I explore technology, creativity, and the simple joy of making things happen.
You might find posts about building data platforms, experimenting with AI, or even stories inspired by my evenings in the garden or long hikes in nature.

Most of this happens late at night, when the house is quiet and the kids are asleep â€” the perfect time to think, create, and write.
And if youâ€™re reading this with a good glass of wine, then youâ€™re already doing it right.

Have fun!
