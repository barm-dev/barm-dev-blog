It feels almost strange to write these words: my very first blog post. For years, I’ve wanted to build this space — a place to share ideas, experiments, and lessons learned. But every time I tried, something got in the way. Too many project ideas, too much perfectionism, and maybe a bit of hesitation to put my work out there.

It’s been a long time since I last developed a web application (hello Symfony 👋), and starting over wasn’t easy. But thanks to the Astro framework — and some help from ChatGPT, both for rewriting my “About” page and even for creating the illustrations — I finally managed to bring this blog to life.

Over the years, I’ve collected countless ideas: projects in data warehouses, BI, AI, and even application building in general. The problem was never a lack of ideas, but the difficulty of turning them into something tangible. They lived in notebooks, drafts, or half-finished prototypes — but rarely became real.

That’s why I’m starting this blog. My goal is to use it as a framework to guide and track my projects, keeping me focused on what really matters: building proof-of-concepts, aiming for an MVP, and resisting the temptation to get lost in secondary details or perfectionism.

So here we are. A first post, finally. I hope this blog will not only keep me accountable, but also turn some of those long-standing ideas into something real. And maybe, along the way, it can inspire or resonate with others too.
