... Reviving My Raspberry Pi 3B: From Jessie to Bookworm (and a Dead SD Card) ...

##### TL;DR

Tried upgrading my old Raspberry Pi 3B, discovered it was still running Raspbian Jessie (2015!), installed Bookworm Lite, enabled SSH, and hit a wall when the SD card died during upgrade. 
Next step: reinstalling Raspberry Pi OS on an external drive to avoid future storage issues.

##### The Surprise: Jessie in 2025?

I was hoping for a quick upgradeâ€”just enable SSH and get going. But of course, things didnâ€™t go as planned.

Turns out the OS installed was **Raspbian Jessie**, released back in 2015 and last updated in 2017. **What?!** Honestly, I thought I had used it more recently. Time flies ðŸ˜…

##### Installing the Latest Raspberry Pi OS

I headed to the official Raspberry Pi OS page [Raspberry Pi Operating Systems](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) for a lite environment. 
I want to save as much space and CPU as possible for Docker (or other lightweight services).

##### Using Raspberry Pi Imager

- Formatted the SD card (32GB > FAT32).
- Had to switch USB ports, apparently Raspberry Pi Imager [doesnâ€™t like USB3](http://reddit.com/r/rasberrypi/comments/13bmqsh/error_writing_to_storage/).
- Inserted the SD card, booted the Piâ€¦ and SSH worked! Victory! ðŸ‘‘

##### Quick System Upgradeâ€¦ or Not

I ran the usual upgrade commands:
```cmd
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
But thenâ€¦ upgrade failed ðŸ˜±
```
dpkg: error processing archive ... Input/output error
dpkg: error while cleaning up: unable to securely remove ... Input/output error
```
Even sudo stopped working:
```
/usr/bin/sudo: Input/output error
```

##### Diagnosis: Dying SD Card
After some research, it seems the SD card is dying. Iâ€™ll need to buy a new oneâ€”and next time, Iâ€™ll install the OS on an external drive to avoid these read/write issues.

##### Lessons Learned
- Always check your OS versionâ€”time flies!
- SD cards wear out. Use external storage for reliability.
- Raspberry Pi Imager has quirks (USB3 issues).
- SSH can be enabled directly in the Imagerâ€”super handy.

##### Whatâ€™s Next?
Reinstalling Raspberry Pi OS on an external drive.
Stay tuned for the next post maybe this time I will progress ðŸ¤ª
